## SQL Queries

In this section, you'll find a range of SQL queries that demonstrate my ability to retrieve, manipulate, and analyze data from relational databases. These queries cover various scenarios, from basic data extraction to more complex transformations.

- [Olympic_2020_analysis](https://github.com/mauricewhitt/github-portfolio/blob/main/Olympics_2020_analysis.sql): Performed Exploratory Data Analysis on the Olympics 2020 Dataset using SQL. With this, I discovered insights such as Top 10 Countries with the Highest number of participants, Top 10 Countries by number of medals won, etc..


## Data Science Projects

In the Data Science Projects section, I present projects that showcase my skills in data analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning. These projects highlight my ability to derive insights from data and make data-driven decisions.

- [Flights Data Exploration](https://github.com/mauricewhitt/github-portfolio/blob/main/Flights%20Data%20Exploration.ipynb): real-world dataset containing flights data from the US Department of Transportation.

- [Real Estate Regression](https://github.com/mauricewhitt/github-portfolio/blob/main/Real%20Estate%20Regression.ipynb): Predicting the selling price of a residential property depends on a number of factors, including the property age, availability of local amenities, and location. The price-per-unit in this data is based on a unit measurement of 3.3 square meters.


## Power BI Visualizations

The Power BI Visualizations section features interactive dashboards and visualizations I've created using Power BI. These examples demonstrate my proficiency in translating data insights into compelling and informative visuals.

- [Bike Sales Report](https://github.com/mauricewhitt/github-portfolio/blob/main/Bike%20Sales%20Report.pdf): Brief description of the dashboard and the data it visualizes.

- [Monkeypox Report](https://github.com/mauricewhitt/github-portfolio/blob/main/Monkeypox2.pdf): Brief description of the dashboard and the data it visualizes.
  
- [Olympics 2020 Analysis Report](https://github.com/mauricewhitt/github-portfolio/blob/main/Olympics%202020%20Analysis.pdf): Brief description of the dashboard and the data it visualizes.
